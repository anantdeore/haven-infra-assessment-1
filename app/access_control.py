B2, part 1 — implement can_access_screening_report().

Read README.md's domain model first. A ScreeningReport belongs to a Tenant, a Tenant belongs to
a Property, and a Property belongs to a LandlordAccount. A PropertyManager is scoped to exactly
one LandlordAccount.

Work out from that hierarchy which boundary actually gates access to a ScreeningReport.
